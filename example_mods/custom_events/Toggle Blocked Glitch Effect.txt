Spawns in a Glitchy-type of effect, notably the effect from 
Blocked 3.0

No values are needed, trigger the event one time to enable it, 
trigger it again to disable it.

THIS WILL NOT WORK IF YOU HAVE A SHADER ADDED TO YOUR SONG BY LUA
YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO LUA SHADERS EXISTING BEFORE USING
(ex. addChromaticAberrationEffect overrides the event here)
